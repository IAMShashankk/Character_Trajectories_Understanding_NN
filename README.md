Completed foolowng tasks:
1. Download Data File from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Trajectories
2. Write a Python script to read and plot the data
3. Visualize one character of each class using your script.
4. Write a Python script to train and test a 1D-CNN classifier:
5. Execute your script and evaluate the performance of the classifier.
6. Write a script to visualize the activations of one layer.
